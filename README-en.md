# The Humanity Declaration of Independence
Independence is justified by the abuses of the governments of the world, when politics oppresses the people and is not for the benefit of humanity. Abuses are of all kinds, among which we can distinguish:
- Wars that benefit a few.
- Territorial violence across geographic barriers.
- Social corruption.
- Manipulation through ignorance.
- Destruction as a way out of social problems.

This letter is a work in progress, publish an **[Issue](https://github.com/proyecto26/social-change/issues)** to express the social problems that exist in your community and let us know how we can improve through a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/proyecto26/social-change/pulls)**.

## Social Problems üö®
### Corrupt system
> We don't do politics, we solve problems through technology, so our position must be neutral, because we seek the same thing.
### We have no memory
> There is a lot of misinformation, we forget our history, we need a reliable source of truth (Single source of truth), reporters and journalists who publicly confirm the facts, in the same space. The media must be our allies, we must share, not compete.
### Political transparency
> A public server must be Open Source, totally open (YouTuber, etc.) to avoid corruption, blackmail, threats and insecurity, we need constant monitoring of everyone and for everyone.
### Taxes and social investment
> The only way to know how to optimize our resources is to see where the town's money is being invested, we need to see where it is being invested, who are in charge and if there are fair contracts compared to local companies.
### Needs of the people
> The people should prioritize social problems through a popular virtual vote (like), they should be able to comment, rate and give recognition to those who do a good job for everyone.
### Poverty and ignorance
> A few control the rest, we need wiser, more educated people, we need to move forward together and stop resorting to violence, fewer people throwing stones, dying in wars and more restless looking into space, towards the unknown.
### Labor unions and Universities
> There are many guilds with little labor demand, we need leaders from each guild, who raise their voices for their labor union, it is necessary to expand their demand to generate fair competition, it is necessary to create new needs that adjust to current social problems, generating opportunity for everybody.
### Technology at the service of humanity
> We need to define limits of what companies can do with technology, define responsibilities and teach new needs where the human being is not going to be replaced by a machine, we need to guide humanity to a new path (Define laws that help us think in people).
### Geographic barriers
> We need to unite as humanity to solve today's problems, starting with the territorial separation imposed by governments around the world, technology breaks those borders and we must overcome those barriers with our example.
### Future of humanity
> Some believe that destruction is the way, the truth is that the difficult thing is to put on our pants to generate intelligent solutions that allow us to advance as humanity to the next level, where we are all important parts of the same system, we must take advantage of the fact that we are many to do more.
### Resources and Outer Space
> We left the caverns and looked into space, what are we doing to conquer it? The earth has a finite source of resources that will be drained unless we go out to take advantage of everything else that surrounds us, we must create projects, form teams, and reward those who make a contribution for humanity to be able to take advantage of everything that the Universe has to give us.

## Solution üì¢
